 - [`SlidingWindowConfig`](@ref).
 - [`SegmentedWindowConfig`](@ref).

    estimate_indicator_changes(config::IndicatorsChangesConfig, x [,t]) â†’ output

Estimate possible transitions for input timeseries `x` using the approach specified
in the configuration type `config`, see [`IndicatorsChangesConfig`](@ref) for possibilities.
`t` is the time vector corresponding to `x`, which defaults to `eachindex(x)`.

Return the output as [`WindowResults`](@ref) which can be given to
[`significant_transitions`](@ref) to deduce which possible transitions are statistically
significant using a variety of significance tests.
